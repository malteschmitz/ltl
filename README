The `ltl' package contains a set of macros for typesetting operators
used in formulas of the linear temporal logic (LTL) in the Manna/Pnueli
or modern character based notation. This package provides options to switch
between characters and symbols as operators. As a backend for the symbols
either the LTLFonts by Matteo Slanina or TikZ drawings provided in this
package can be used.
